# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I didn't think to fork this repo until today (Day 14), so you will see that this journal starts on that day. I started June 27, 2018 and missed Day 2.

### Day 14: July 11, 2018
##### Working on Project 3 in the Front End Nanodegree course offered by Udacity through a Grow with Google scholarship

**Today's Progress**: Last night I started working on it, I wrote the Player class with methods for moving, but not leaving the canvas. Today, I perfected the player's movements so that when the player wins, the hero can be seen in the top row of blocks on the canvas before the alert box pops up to tell the user they won the game. The hero's position is only reset once the player clicks 'ok' on the alert box.

**Thoughts:** I learned about how to use `window.confirm('string')`, which was fun, but it took some time to find this solution.

**Update** I finished the project and submitted it for the first time. I don't expect it to pass this time, but I will complete some other coursework until I hear back from my reviewer. Woo!
