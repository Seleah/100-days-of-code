# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I didn't think to fork this repo until today (Day 14), so you will see that this journal starts on that day. I started June 27, 2018 and missed Day 2.

### Day 14: July 11, 2018
##### Working on Project 3 in the Front End Nanodegree course offered by Udacity through a Grow with Google scholarship

**Today's Progress**: Last night I started working on it, I wrote the Player class with methods for moving, but not leaving the canvas. Today, I perfected the player's movements so that when the player wins, the hero can be seen in the top row of blocks on the canvas before the alert box pops up to tell the user they won the game. The hero's position is only reset once the player clicks 'ok' on the alert box.

**Thoughts:** I learned about how to use `window.confirm('string')`, which was fun, but it took some time to find this solution.

**Link to work:** [Mock Arcade Game](https://seleah.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

**Update** I finished the project and submitted it for the first time. I don't expect it to pass this time, but I will complete some other coursework until I hear back from my reviewer. Woo!

### Day 15: July 12, 2018
##### Project 3 passed on the first submission!

**Today's Progress**: Suprisingly, my project passed on the first submission (which only rarely happens) so I'm going through lessons for today.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure what to do about my laptop... These lessons involve setting up your environment with Sublime and Gulp, but I have a chromebook... We'll see.

### Day 16: July 13, 2018
##### Lots of coursework.

**Today's Progress**: Just starting for today, so no progress to note atm, just making sure I don't forget to log my day. I will add an update later.

**Thoughts:** So it looks like I'm going to need Crouton. *sigh* Here goes. I'm nervous I'll break my laptop. Pray for me! lol It doesn't seem like it's difficult at all, it's just not something I've done before and so the lack of experience makes me nervous.

Another thought. I noticed Github doesn't count contributions to my forked repos. This makes me sad. No big deal though. It just means that if I want my contributions counted, I'll need to do commit on repos that are not forked.

### Day 17: July 14, 2018
##### More coursework.

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to get some help with getting my laptop set up with Crouton, seeing as I've never done anything like that in my life and I could easily mess up my laptop.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited about getting set up with new tools for development! I'm looking to get Sublime and Gulp and start working with Sass.

### Day 18: July 16, 2018
##### Setup day!

**Today's Progress**: Got some help with getting my laptop set up with Crouton. He tried to help last night, but couldn't get it to work, so now it's up to me. Pray for me! Did some schoolwork so that I got my coding time in before we start. Also, I backed up my laptop because you know stuff can happen...

**Thoughts:** Scared. Just scared. I really don't wanna mess this up.

**Update:** It worked! I'm all set up with Ubuntu, Git, Node.js, Sublime, NPM, Sass, autoprefixer, etc. I've been playing with it all and I'm in love. It's all set up so I can run Ubuntu in a window so I can switch back and forth between ChromeOS and Linux ^_^

### Day 19: July 17, 2018
##### Coursework.

**Today's Progress**: Learning about linting today. 

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool. I can't believe I've gotten this far without all of these tools! I guess you start with an actual saw before you get to use the electric ones, right?

### Day 20: July 18, 2018
##### Coursework.

**Today's Progress**: Progressing through the coursework towards getting Project 4 done. 

### Day 21: July 19, 2018
##### Coursework.

**Today's Progress**: Setting up with Jasmine and PhantomJs. Struggling to get it all working. 

### Day 22: July 20, 2018
##### Coursework.

**Today's Progress**:  I'm struggling. HARD. I'm trying to follow course instructions on how to set up your environment, but I'm on a Chromebook. I've been able to piece it together myself up until now. My current struggles are with trying to get jasmine and phantomjs to work.

**Update**: Got it. I was using the wrong command. _ugh_

### Day 23: July 21, 2018
##### Coursework.

**Today's Progress**: Finally got jasmine and phantomjs working with Ubuntu yesterday, so I'm moving on! I have a lot to get done, so I will be on here for a WHILE today!

### Day 24: July 22, 2018
##### Coursework.

**Today's Progress**:  Just more schoolwork. Looking to get a few hours in today ^\_^

### Day 25: July 23, 2018
##### Coursework.

**Today's Progress**: Working with Jasmine and writing my first test suites. So long, `console.log()`! Haha... yeah.
