# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I didn't think to fork this repo until today (Day 14), so you will see that this journal starts on that day. I started June 27, 2018 and missed Day 2.

### Day 14: July 11, 2018
##### Working on Project 3 in the Front End Nanodegree course offered by Udacity through a Grow with Google scholarship

**Today's Progress**: Last night I started working on it, I wrote the Player class with methods for moving, but not leaving the canvas. Today, I perfected the player's movements so that when the player wins, the hero can be seen in the top row of blocks on the canvas before the alert box pops up to tell the user they won the game. The hero's position is only reset once the player clicks 'ok' on the alert box.

**Thoughts:** I learned about how to use `window.confirm('string')`, which was fun, but it took some time to find this solution.

**Update** I finished the project and submitted it for the first time. I don't expect it to pass this time, but I will complete some other coursework until I hear back from my reviewer. Woo!

### Day 15: July 12, 2018
##### Project 3 passed on the first submission!

**Today's Progress**: Suprisingly, my project passed on the first submission (which only rarely happens) so I'm going through lessons for today.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure what to do about my laptop... These lessons involve setting up your environment with Sublime and Gulp, but I have a chromebook... We'll see.

### Day 16: July 13, 2018
##### Lots of coursework.

**Today's Progress**: Just starting for today, so no progress to note atm, just making sure I don't forget to log my day. I will add an update later.

**Thoughts:** So it looks like I'm going to need Crouton. *sigh* Here goes. I'm nervous I'll break my laptop. Pray for me! lol It doesn't seem like it's difficult at all, it's just not something I've done before and so the lack of experience makes me nervous.

Another thought. I noticed Github doesn't count contributions to my forked repos. This makes me sad. No big deal though. It just means that if I want my contributions counted, I'll need to do commit on repos that are not forked.
